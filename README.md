# Geo Data Analysis:
1. The first notebook is all about loading different geo data formats and get geo-viz for direct hunch of the data
2. The figure might not be rendered in github, pls move @https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sooner0931/GeoDataProcessing-Viz/blob/master/GeoProcessing%26GeoViz.ipynb to see the full content
3. The geo-viz is the first step of checking geo data, but it might fool us in a sense of eyeballing, so next step is to use geo statistical techniques to see what's the TRUE patterns or confirm what we have got from geo-viz. All aspects possible: cluster, classification...


4. move @https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sooner0931/GeoDataProcessing-Viz/blob/master/data_viz.ipynb
